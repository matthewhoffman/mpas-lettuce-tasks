To install (On Ubuntu):

	Setup PIP:
		sudo apt-get install pip

	Setup Jenkins:
		(http://jenkins-ci.org/)
		wget -q -O - http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/jenkins-ci.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
		deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian binary/
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install jenkins

	Setup Lettuce:
		sudo -E pip install lettuce
		sudo -E C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/mpi pip install netcdf4

To use:
	You probably need to edit the mpas_tasks.py script to have the correct
	location for ocean_model.

	Once you have the script modified. The directory this repository creates
	needs to be called features. Then you simply run `lettuce from above the
	features directory.
