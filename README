To install (On Ubuntu):

	Setup PIP:
		sudo apt-get install pip

	Setup Lettuce:
		sudo -E pip install lettuce
		sudo -E C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/mpi pip install netcdf4

Layout:
    Within this repository, each core gets it's own directory, with it's own
    feature and task definitions. The task directory contains shared tasks that
    all cores should be able to use.

    Task files from the tasks directory should be symlinked into each of the
    component directories.

To use:
	You probably need to edit the mpas_tasks.py script to have the correct
	location for ocean_model.

	Once you have the script modified. The directory this repository creates
	needs to be called features. Then you simply run `lettuce from above the
	features directory.

    You can pass the directory for a particular feature set into lettuce, i.e.:
    `lettuce features/ocean`
    to test just the features related to a specific core.
